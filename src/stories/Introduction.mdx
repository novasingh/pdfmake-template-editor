# Welcome to PDFMake Editor Storybook

This Storybook documents the components used in the **PDFMake Editor**, a drag-and-drop tool for creating PDF templates using `pdfmake`.

## Getting Started

The editor is built with React, Zustand, and Dnd-Kit. It allows users to:
1.  **Drag and Drop** blocks from the sidebar to the canvas.
2.  **Edit Properties** of selected elements using the properties panel.
3.  **Export** the final design to PDF.

## Core Components

- **TemplateEditor**: The main container that orchestrates the editor state and layout.
- **PageCanvas**: The droppable area where the PDF document is visualized.
- **Sidebar**: Contains the draggable building blocks (Heading, Paragraph, Tables, etc.).
- **PropertiesPanel**: Context-aware panel for editing the currently selected element.

## State Management

We use `zustand` for state management. The store (`useEditorStore`) handles:
- The document structure (sections, columns, elements).
- Selection state.
- Drag and drop reordering logic.

## Styling

All styles are centralized in `src/styles`. Components import their respective CSS files from there.
